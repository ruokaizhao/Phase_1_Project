Phase-1 Project

When the page loaded, it will retrieve data a public API and render the information to the page.

One the top of the page, there is a search bar which allows users to search for a MCU movie by its name, the page will show the movie/movies the user searched for(it does not need to be the precise name of the movie, just a portion of the movie title would be suffice to complete the search, also the search keywords are not case sensitive), or popup a alert saying "No matches..." if there is no match.

Underneath the search bar, there is a drop down menu with options of "All phases, phase I to IV", after choosing one specific phase, the page will be re-rendered to only show movies belong to that phase.

The information is categorized by movie titles, with title, box office, release date.

There is a button "Increase box office by 10 million", which when clicked, will increase the box office by 10 million (just fictional).

Underneath the "Increase box office..." button, there is a storyline triangle, when clicked, will show the storyline of the movie.

On the bottom of each container, there is a "Play trailer" button, which when clicked, will show the trailer of the movie using iframe tag, and remove the iframe when clicked again.
